## ðŸ¤– Automation Features

This repo includes a fully automated TypeScript setup to:
- Fetch daily puzzle input and description (`setup.ts`)
- Generate boilerplate code for `part1.ts`, `part2.ts`, and `test.ts`
- Submit answers with `run.ts` and track progress using `meta.json`
- Optionally move to the next day's puzzle after successful submission

Everything is organized under: `year/dayXX/`.
